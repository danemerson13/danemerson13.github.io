Welcome to my website! I am a first year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University. I am advised by [Professor Levent Burak Kara](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/_files/archives/original-bios/kara.html) in the Mechanical Engineering Department as part of the [Visual Design and Engineering Lab (VDEL)](http://vdel.me.cmu.edu/). My research currently focused on using machine learning to improve modeling of the cardiovascular system.
